New developers should add their own subdirectory here for their own code:

    ../biopieces/code_ruby/lib/maasha           # this is my code directory.
    ../biopieces/code_ruby/lib/<new developer>  # this could be your new code directory.

Test code goes in:

    ../biopieces/code_ruby/test/maasha           # this is my test directory.
    ../biopieces/code_ruby/test/<new developer>  # this could be your new test directory.

All done.
