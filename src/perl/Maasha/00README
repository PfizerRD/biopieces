These are modules written by me (Martin A. Hansen aka Maasha).

You are welcome to modify the code here, but do leave a note in
the subroutines you change like this:

    sub some_subroutine
    {
        # Martin A. Hansen, Jan 2008.

        # Changed by <you>, Juli 2008. (fixed minor bug)
        
        ...
    }

You may also add new subroutines, but you should strongly consider
adding your own Perl modules subdirectory. For more information, see:

    ../biopieces/code_perl/README
