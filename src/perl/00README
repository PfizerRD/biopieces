New developers should add their own subdirectory here for their own Perl code:

    ../biopieces/code_perl/Maasha           # this is my code directory.
    ../biopieces/code_perl/<new developer>  # this could be your new code directory.

Finally, add your new Perl code directory to the PERL5LIB path in the configuration:

    ../biopieces/bp_conf/bashrc  # look inside this file for information on how to do that.


All done.
